        <h1>Overwatch</h1>
        <img src="assets/images/overwatch.jpg" width="500" alt="overwatch">
        <p><b>Overwatch</b> is a multiplayer team-based first-person shooter developed and published by 
            Blizzard Entertainment.</p>
        <p>In a time of global crisis, an international task force of heroes banded together to restore 
            peace to a war-torn world. This organization, known as Overwatch, ended the crisis and helped 
            maintain peace for a generation, inspiring an era of exploration, innovation, and discovery. 
            After many years, Overwatch's influence waned and it was eventually disbanded. Now in the 
            wake of its dismantling, conflict is rising once again. Overwatch may be gone... but the 
            world still needs heroes.</p>
        <p>Choose A Hero: Overwatch features a wide array of unique Heroes, ranging from a time-jumping 
            adventurer, to an armored, rocket-hammer-wielding warrior, to a transcendent robot monk. 
            Every hero plays differently, and mastering their Abilities is the key to unlocking their 
            potential. No two heroes are the same.</p>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Overwatch is an online team-based game generally played as a first-person shooter. 
            The game features several different game modes, principally designed around squad-based 
            combat with two opposing teams of six players each. Players select one of over two dozen 
            pre-made hero characters from one of three class types: Damage heroes that deal most of the 
            damage to attack or defend control points, Tank heroes that can absorb a large amount of 
            damage, and Support heroes that provide healing or other buffs for their teammates. Each 
            hero has a unique skill kit, defining their intrinsic attributes like health points and 
            running speed, their primary attacks, several active and passive skills, and an ultimate 
            ability that can only be used after it has been charged through dealing damage to enemies 
            and healing allies. Players can change their hero during the course of a match, as a goal 
            of Overwatch's design was to encourage dynamic team compositions that adapt to the situation. 
            The game's genre has been described by some journalists as a "hero shooter", due to its 
            design around specific heroes and classes.</p>
        <p>The game features game modes for casual play, competitive ranked play, and for supporting 
            esports competitions including Blizzard's Overwatch League. These modes generally are 
            centered around sequentially securing control of points on the map, or escorting a payload 
            between points on the map, with one team attacking while the other defends. Other modes 
            set aside for casual matches include solo and team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and unique 
            modes run during various seasonal events. More recent updates have enabled users to craft 
            their own game modes with a limited set of scripting tools. New characters and maps have 
            been added regularly to the game since launch, expanding the original hero roster from 21 
            to 32 by April 2020. Regardless of winning or losing a match, players gain experience 
            towards a player level, and on gaining a new level, receive loot boxes that contain cosmetic 
            items that they can use to customize the appearance of the hero characters but otherwise does 
            not affect gameplay. Loot boxes can also be purchased through microtransactions.</p>
        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>The backstory to Overwatch is described through animated shorts and other information 
            distributed by Blizzard in promoting the game.</p>
        <p>Overwatch is set sixty years into the future of a fictionalized Earth, thirty years after 
            the resolution of what is known as the "Omnic Crisis."[8] Before the Omnic Crisis, humanity 
            had been in a golden age of prosperity and technology development. Humans developed robots 
            with artificial intelligence called "Omnics", which were put to use to achieve economic 
            equality, and began to be treated as people in their own right. The Omnic Crisis began when 
            the worldwide automated "omnium" facilities that produced them started producing a series of 
            lethal, hostile robots that attacked humankind. Initially, individual countries responded with 
            various programs: the United States developed its Soldier Enhancement Program to produce elite 
            fighters, for example, while Germany assembled the knight-like Crusaders. When these efforts 
            failed to ward off the Omnics, the United Nations quickly formed Overwatch, an international 
            task force combining these individual programs to combat this threat and restore order.</p>
        <p>Two veteran soldiers from the Soldier Enhancement Program were put in charge of Overwatch: 
            Gabriel Reyes and Jack Morrison. Though Overwatch successfully quelled the robotic uprising 
            and brought many talented individuals to the forefront, a rift developed between Reyes and 
            Morrison. Morrison was made the leader of Overwatch while Reyes was given charge of Blackwatch, 
            Overwatch's covert operations division, fighting terrorist organizations like Talon, a group 
            that appears to be trying to start a second Omnic Crisis, and Null Sector, a group of Omnics 
            that revolted against the society that persecuted Omnics following the first Crisis. Overwatch 
            continued to maintain peace across the world for several decades in what came to be called the 
            "Overwatch Generation" as the team gained more members, but the rift between Morrison and Reyes 
            intensified. Several allegations of wrongdoing and failures were leveled at Overwatch, leading 
            to a public outcry against the organization and in-fighting between its members, prompting the 
            UN to investigate the situation. During this, an explosion destroyed Overwatch's headquarters 
            in Switzerland, purportedly killing Morrison and Reyes among others. The UN passed the Petras 
            Act, which dismantled Overwatch and forbade any Overwatch-type activity.</p>
